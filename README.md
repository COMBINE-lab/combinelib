# combinelib

This repository holds an assortment of random, potentially-useful utility functions and classes.  The code is expected to be mostly C/C++.  It contains both utility classes from various authors that may be useful in multiple projects.  The idea is to keep these in a central location where they can be updated and copied over to individual repositories as need be, so that bug fixes, improvements, etc. can be applied in a single place.
